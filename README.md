# Kotlin-RayTracer

This is a self-study project. After my beloved ABAP-RayTracer, it is time to move on. I got inspired to do in Sydney/Australia üê® during my time at Animal Logic. Kudos to the development team there.

I gonna teach myself writing a ray tracer with Kotlin with the help of the book "Ray Tracing from the Ground Up" üìó by Kevin Suffern.

My goal is to to educate myself on the math behind ray tracing and improve my Kotlin skills.
